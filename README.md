# Haxor App

by [@brunodb3](https://github.com/brunodb3)

This project was bootstrapped with [Ionic CLI](https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/start) using the `blank` template, with `--type=angular`.

The intent of this project is to create a mobile game to teach players about server security and pen-testing tools in a fun and interactive way.

### Note

When you clone the repo, you need to create two files, `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`, inside the `src/environments/` folder, based on `src/environments/environment.example.ts`. These files contain environment variables for the project (such as Firebase configuration keys).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `ng serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run commit`

Creates a new commit using on Commitizen, to make standard commit messages. Works really well with standard-version (see below - `release` script).

For more information, check the [Commitizen repository](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

### `npm run release`

Creates a new release, bumping the project version and adding changes to `CHANGELOG.md`, according to commit messages.
